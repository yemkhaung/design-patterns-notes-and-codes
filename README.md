# Design Patterns Notes & Codes (Java)

Design patterns are **tried and true** best practices of building maintainable, extensible applications. A properly designd application will go a long way for further maintanance phases, new features, etc.

It is critical for a mid-level software developer with **3 or 4 years experience** to know what and when to use design patterns. Also important for aspiring fresh developers to start learning design patterns after knowing basic **Object-oriented** principles.

This repository contains summarized notes and sample source codes about **Design Patterns* for *Object-Oriented* languages using **Java**.

* Notes can be found in `/docs` folder.
* Source codes can be found in `/src` folder.
* Design patterns are organized into *Creational*, *Structural* and *Behavioral* categories based on their use cases.

Best Regards.
